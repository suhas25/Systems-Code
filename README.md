# Systems Projects
Here's a compilation of projects I have worked on as a part of my Computer Systems class (COMP 321) at Rice University.\
Linking.c: A program, which reads the linkage information from a Java Class File (JCF).\
tinyshell.c: A simple Unix shell program that supports job control.\
Malloc.c: An effcient dynamic memory allocator for C programs, (my own version of the malloc, free, and realloc routines).\
Proxy.c: A concurrent web proxy that logs requests.
